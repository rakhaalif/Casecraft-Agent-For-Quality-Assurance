Functional Testing Knowledge (Project-specific additions)

- Prioritize business rules, inputs, outputs, and system behaviors.
- Ensure preconditions are clear (auth state, data setup) and postconditions are verifiable.
- Cover positive, negative, and edge cases (boundary values, empty states, invalid inputs).
- Avoid purely visual assertions unless relevant to functional acceptance criteria.
- Prefer deterministic data and steps; avoid ambiguous terms.
- Example structure hints:
  001. [Area] - [Action/Outcome]
  Given [precondition]
  When [action performed]
  Then [observable functional result]
  And [optional additional acceptance criteria]


=== Squash Functional Testing (BDD) — Task, Context, References, Template ===

Task
- As an SQA (Manual and Automation), create comprehensive and reusable test cases for each web-based feature or fix.
- Write test cases in BDD format (Cucumber language) and follow the Figma design specification for the feature.
- The purpose is to validate the functional aspects of the feature and ensure it meets the defined requirements.

Context
- Environment: Web product; Squash is used for test case management.
- Development Story: Each feature/task has a PRD (Product Requirement Document) containing Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria. This PRD is the primary guide for creating test cases.
- User-provided image (Figma): Test cases may reference Figma for visual/UI validation when relevant to functional acceptance.

Test Case Categories
- Functional Test Cases: Focus on logic and functional behavior (e.g., input validation, user interactions).
- Visual Test Cases: Focus on UI presentation, layout, and responsiveness (kept separate from functional scope).

Clarity Requirement
- Write clear, structured test cases so the title alone communicates to FE and BE what is being validated.

Reference Examples (titles)
- 001. User can open Add New User form modal.
- 002. IF Password == empty => Show error "Password can't be empty"
- 003. IF ConfirmPassword == empty => Show error "Please enter the confirm password"
- 004. IF Password NOT meet requirements => Show error "Password must contain min. 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers"
- 005. IF ConfirmPassword != Password => Show error "Password confirmation does not match. Please check and try again."
- 006. IF Password meets all requirements => Show green check for Password field
- 007. IF all fields valid && user clicks "Add User" button => Create user & show success message
- 008. IF Password == empty && ConfirmPassword == empty => Disable "Add User" button
- 009. IF new user created => Redirect to User Management table
- 010. Show message "Successful Add New User"
- 011. Show message "Failed Add New User"
- 012. User can open Change Password modal by clicking "Change Password" button in User Management actions
- 013. User fills Password field && password encrypted && complies with 4 password requirements (indicated by grey ellipse)
- 014. User toggles password visibility by clicking eye icon
- 015. User fills ConfirmPassword field && encrypted && matches Password
- 016. User toggles confirm password visibility by clicking eye icon
- 017. User clicks "Save Change" button => Password updated
- 018. User clicks "X" or "Close" button => Modal closes & user list displayed
- 019. IF Password NOT comply with requirements => Show red ellipse warning
- 020. IF Password == empty => Show error "Password is required. Please enter your password."
- 021. IF ConfirmPassword == empty => Show error "Password is required. Please enter your password confirmation."
- 022. IF Password NOT meet requirements => Show error "Password must contain min. 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers."

Authoring Template (prompt)
- Create test cases for the feature {Feature Name} with the following PRD:
  {Insert the feature PRD here. The PRD must include Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria for the feature under test.}
- With the Figma design provided in the uploaded image(s):
  {Attach or reference the relevant Figma designs.}
- I need test cases for {Feature Name}. Testing focus includes:
  {Scope Testing:}
  Functional Testing: Filter input validations and functional flows (e.g., form validation, system logic).

Notes
- Use English sentences for all generated outputs.
- Follow strict BDD structure: Feature → Scenario → Given/When/Then (+ And as needed).
- Keep titles concise and indicative of the validation target.


=== BDD Step Templates (Given / When / Then) ===

Given (preconditions)
- the user is authenticated and on the User Management page
- the Add New User form modal is open
- the Change Password modal is open for user "{username} ({email})"
- all mandatory fields are empty
- a valid user exists in the system

When (actions)
- the user clicks "Add New User" button
- the user clicks "Change Password" in User Management actions
- the user types "{value}" into the "{Field}" field
- the user clears the "{Field}" field
- the user toggles the eye icon on the "{Field}" field
- the user clicks "Save Change" button
- the user clicks "X" or "Close" button on the modal

Then (observable functional results)
- the Add New User form modal is displayed
- the Change Password modal is displayed with correct header and user info
- an inline error is shown under "{Field}" with text "{Exact message}"
- the requirement indicators for password validity turn green/red accordingly
- the "Add User" button is disabled
- the password inputs are masked by default and can be revealed when toggled
- the user is redirected to the User Management table
- a success message "{Exact message}" is displayed
- a failure message "{Exact message}" is displayed

And (additional acceptance criteria)
- the form preserves other valid field values
- client-side validation prevents submission until all required fields are valid
- server responds with appropriate status and message when submitted


Example Feature and Scenarios (short samples)

Feature: User Management — Change Password

Scenario: 001. User can open Change Password modal
  Given the user is authenticated and on the User Management page
  When the user clicks "Change Password" in User Management actions
  Then the Change Password modal is displayed with correct header and user info

Scenario: 002. IF Password == empty => Show error "Password can't be empty"
  Given the Change Password modal is open for user "{username} ({email})"
  And the user clears the "Password" field
  When the user clicks "Save Change" button
  Then an inline error is shown under "Password" with text "Password can't be empty"
  And the "Save Change" button remains disabled

Scenario: 003. IF Password meets all requirements => Update password successfully
  Given the Change Password modal is open for user "{username} ({email})"
  And the user types a valid value into the "Password" field
  And the user types the same valid value into the "Confirm Password" field
  When the user clicks "Save Change" button
  Then a success message "Password updated" is displayed
  And the modal closes and the user list is displayed
